# Escornabot Android App

Escornabot remote control APP provides a way to connect to an Escornabot robot equiped with a Bluetooth adapter and control it by using an Android phone.

Escornabot bluetooth adapter and Android phone should have been paired previously or APP will offer a system first-time pairing dialog.

After pairing with the device, APP presents with the main control activity that can work in two modes. A default **batch mode** where you can select commands and preview a buffer in the APP, commands in the buffer can be removed or sent as a whole to the paired Escornabot by pressing GO.

A second mode is the **Control Panel** mode, where buttons in the Android phone behave similar to buttons on the robot physical control panel. So pressing a button, sends that command immediatly to the Escornabot instead of placing it on the buffer.

To know if the Escornabot is currently connected and paired with your device, pay attention to the led present on your BT adapter, it should be fixed and not blinking. _Just restart the APP in case everything goes wronk :)_
